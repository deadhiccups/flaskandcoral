# stream-video-to-web

This is code I found that uses flask to stream your webcam to a browser.  I modified it to use the Coral AI co-processor for object detection.
Coral AI coprocessor works with Python 3.9.0.  I used pyenv to change my python version so this would run.

```
# Usage
python3 main.py
```
Navigate to url and port.
